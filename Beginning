Installed the location app dependencies, next step is to write the first line of code
Figuring out how to get the location of a website visitor. Discovered that I can use google maps api for this so I will try to use that. 
11/04 - Generated an API Key from Google Maps. I have $300 of credits left. Created a googleMapsAPIkey.js file to store the key. 
12/04 - No code today
13/04 - Trying to figure out how to get country location of website visitor. Using google maps api doesn't work because of Shopify's policies. Next step is to get
location via ip using GeoJS.
15/04 Trying to wrap my head around how to insert the GeoJS code. Will watch a video about how to make a simple app using Remix and will go from there.
